    "<p>Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that affects the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It is typically caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a sexually transmitted infection. Other contributing factors to the development of cervical cancer can include a weakened immune system, smoking, and having multiple sexual partners. Regular screening tests, such as Pap tests, can help detect cervical cancer early, when it is most treatable. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. It is important to reduce the impact of this disease because it can have serious health consequences. Early detection and treatment are key, as well as reducing the risk of developing cervical cancer by practicing safe sex and getting vaccinated against HPV.</p>"
